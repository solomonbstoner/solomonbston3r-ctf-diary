# Welcome To Solomonbston3r's CTF Diary

The diary of a n00b in the unfamiliar and terrifying venture into Capture-the-flag, either solo or part of a team.

This repository contains writeups of challenges I am and am not able to solve. I find that documenting my progress is a great source of motivation.

* Please feel free to use any part of my writeup. 
* Please also feel free to constructively point out any mistakes I make, for that helps me learn.
* If you do not understand any part of my writeup, you are welcome to leave a question. 
* Should I have doubts myself, I will open an `Issue`. Your guidance will be greatly appreciated.

I am excited to see how much we can achieve together.
