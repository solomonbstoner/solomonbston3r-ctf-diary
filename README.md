# Welcome To Solomonbston3r's CTF Diary

I originally started this repository to keep track of *my* own progress on Capture The Flags. However, I had the honour of meeting new friends with whom I have the pleasure of participating with online and face-to-face Capture the Flag competition. 

This repository contains writeups of challenges ~~I am and am~~ we are and are not able to solve. I find that documenting ~~my~~ our progress is a great source of motivation.

* Please feel free to use any part of my/our writeup. 
* Please also feel free to constructively point out any mistakes we/I make, for that helps me/us learn.
* If you do not understand any part of my/our writeup, you are welcome to leave a question. 
* Should I/we have doubts, I/we will open an `Issue`. Your guidance will be greatly appreciated.

I am excited to see how much we can achieve together.
