We are given a file `capture.pcap`. Because the file and directory are world-readable, we can copy the file to whereever we want. I copied it to my desktop and opened it in wireshark. Following the TCP stream (Analyze -> Follow -> TCP Stream), we are given the following output:

```
..%..%..&..... ..#..'..$..&..... ..#..'..$.. .....#.....'........... .38400,38400....#.SodaCan:0....'..DISPLAY.SodaCan:0......xterm.........."........!........"..".....b........b....	B.

At first glance It looks like the password is `backdoor...00Rm8.ate`, but it is *not*. The dots are not ASCII dots. They represent hex values that do not correspond to printable ASCII values. Viewing it under hex dump gives us a clearer picture.

Turns out, the dots are actually `0x7F`, which is hex for `del`. The user keyed in his password, but not before deleting and retyping some of the characters.

His password is actually `backd00Rmate`. Even though the packet dump shows that the login is for `level08`, the password actually works to login as `flag08`. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

```
level08@nebula:/home/flag08$ su flag08
Password: 
sh-4.2$ getflag
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account
sh-4.2$ exit
```
